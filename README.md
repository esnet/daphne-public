# Deep Learning and Artificial Intelligence for High-Performance Networks (DAPHNE Lab)

The DAPHNE team is part of the Scientific Networking and Computational Research Divisions of Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. The group is led by Dr. Mariam Kiran.
This project is funded under DOE ASCR Early Career Project 2017-2022.

Our research explores machine learning, deep learning and AI techniques when applied to operational networking and distributed computing problems.

With advances in computing, data is being produced at exponential rates requiring highly flexible mobility across HPC computing and distributed facilities. Networks are the essential bloodline to science collaborations across the globe such as in high-energy physics, earth sciences and genomics. However, upgrading network hardware, with high-end routers and optic fibers, to cope with this data revolution can cost millions of dollars. We are exploring artificial intelligence to design and efficiently manage distributed network architectures to improve data transfers or routing, guarantee high-throughput and improve traffic engineering.
